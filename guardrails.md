# Guardrails

## Rules
- Make ONE change per iteration, verify it, then commit
- Run `npm run lint` after each change to verify
- Do not refactor working code beyond the specific fix
- Do not add new dependencies
- Preserve existing behavior — only fix issues, don't change functionality
- Keep commits atomic and descriptive
